This project is a machine learning-powered web application built with Flask to predict the chances of admission for a student into a university based on academic and profile parameters such as GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, SOP, and research experience.
# üéì Admission Prediction Web App

A machine learning-based web application built using **Flask** that predicts a student's **chance of admission** to a university based on academic profile and research experience.

## üîç About the Project

This project uses a trained machine learning model to predict the **probability of graduate school admission** based on key factors such as GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, university rating, SOP & LOR strengths, and research experience. The prediction is presented as a **percentage chance of admission**.

---

## üß† Machine Learning Details

- **Dataset:** [Graduate Admission Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)
- **Target Variable:** `Chance of Admit`
- **Algorithm Used:** `GradientBoostingClassifier` (converted `Chance of Admit` to binary for classification: ‚â• 0.8 = Admit)
- **Scaler Used:** `StandardScaler` from `sklearn`
- **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy scores compared across multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

## üßæ Features

- Takes 7 input features from the user:
  - GRE Score
  - TOEFL Score
  - University Rating
  - SOP Strength
  - LOR Strength
  - CGPA
  - Research Experience (Yes/No)
- Predicts the **chance of admission** (e.g., `66.0%`)
- User-friendly web interface built with **Flask + HTML**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Basic)
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **ML Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Joblib
- **Deployment Ready:** Localhost (can be deployed to Heroku, Render, etc.)
